			<p>And everybody knows what's under the door
			And everybody goes to great lengths, for sure
			To hide themselves away and keep the beast at bay
			'Cause everybody knows

			[Chorus]
			Trapdoor, trapdoor, the trapdoor's a trap!
			Trapdoor, trapdoor, the trapdoor's a trap!
			Trapdoor, trapdoor, the trapdoor's a trap!
			Trapdoor, trapdoor, the trapdoor's a trap!</p>

			<p>2 My body's overworked
			It's just the same I know
			When can my body work
			Cold static overload?
			My body works, I know
			It's just the same, I know
			My only difference
			Is robot influence

			[Post-Chorus 1]
			I'm up here for the weirdo swarm
			I'm the door when you come for more

			[Bridge]
			One, two, three!

			[Verse 2]
			Limber up
			Time is up</p>

			<p>The drippin' tap won't be turned off by the
			Suits in charge of the world and our
			Future's hangin' on by a thread
			With our heads in the sand, woo!
			The drippin' tap won't be turned off by the
			Gods up above us, Big Sky Country
			That we never hear from in these
			Times of our dyin' needs

			[Instrumental Break]

			[Verse 1: All]
			Woo!
			A familiar sound ignored
			The compartmentalized thoughts
			In that back corner of the drawer
			That drip, drip on the floor
			Don't get drowned
			Hee hee hee, woo!
			Heed that sound
			Hee hee hee, woo!</p></div>
